# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – Core Implementations in JavaScript

This repository contains my **basic implementations of common Data Structures and Algorithms** using JavaScript.  
It's meant for learning and understanding how each concept works internally — not just solving problems.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

| Topic         | Implementations Included |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Arrays        | Reverse, Rotate, Insert/Delete |
| Strings       | Palindrome, Anagram check |
| Stacks        | Using Arrays and Linked List |
| Queues        | Simple Queue, Circular Queue |
| Linked Lists  | Singly, Doubly, Insert/Delete/Search |
| Trees         | Binary Tree, BST, Traversals (DFS/BFS) |
| Searching     | Linear Search, Binary Search |
| Sorting       | Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick |
| Hashing       | Hash Tables, Collision Handling (basic) |
| Recursion     | Factorial, Fibonacci, Tree Traversals |

## 🤔 Why This Repo?

I created this as a personal reference and learning resource — to understand how data structures **really work under the hood** without using pre-built libraries.

It helps reinforce concepts before diving into solving problems on platforms like LeetCode.
